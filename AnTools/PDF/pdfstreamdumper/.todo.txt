graphing: handled x = function() declares in other functions

test: autocomplete dialog disappearing as you keep typing? - should be fixed..

refactor form overrides fail on global screipt + can not rename functions

------------------------
new rtclick menu handles this pretty well..
jsui, if word under cursor is a recgonized function name, and user is holding ctrl, turn it blue and underline
      if they click, navigate to function (lot of work with the func list sitting right there..but with a shift
      too could be search all..handy but allot of work

-----------------
   nope cant do without replicating findall dialog in ocx (unless i implement it in the ocx..ok..)

x- jsui find all column to show which function the result is in? ( .CurrentFunction )
x- jsui keep track of line positions on function click and have back forward buttons
-----------------


graph ui navigate on node click (pita)
